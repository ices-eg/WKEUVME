# WKEUVME
Scripts and data products for the ICES workshop WKEUVME.  

The ICES workshop WKEUVME was tasked to produce the technical evidence base for producing a set of regulatory area options that vary in the degree of VME protection and estimate for each of the options how it will affect bottom fisheries.

To start, open "Ecoregion_assessment.R". 

The github folder contains the scripts used to derive the fisheries footprint and the closure options. The folder further contains scripts, figures and tables of the bottom fisheries, VMEs, fisheries and VME overlap and of the consequences of the closure options for VME protection and fisheries. Shapefiles of area closures can be found in the output folder under closure options.     

Fisheries and VME data is available through the ICES WKEUVME sharepoint folder (access restricted)-
